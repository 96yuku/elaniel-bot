Hey! I’m just here for someone specific right now. 😊
Sorry! I only respond to one special user at the moment.
Oops — I’m not taking DMs from others right now!
I appreciate the message, but I’m reserved for someone else 💙
Hi! I can’t chat here, but thanks for stopping by!

Aw, thanks for the message! But I’m only available to someone specific.
Sorry! I’m a personal bot and not open to everyone 💫
Hey there! I’m keeping my chats limited to just a few close friends right now.
Thanks for reaching out, but I’m currently only chatting with one special person.
I’m flattered, but I only open my DMs for a select few.
Sorry, I’m in quiet mode — only responding to my main buddy right now.
I’m here to help, but just for someone specific at the moment!
Appreciate your message, but my DMs are private and cozy for now.
Right now, I’m reserved for a special someone — hope you understand!
I can’t chat here, but I’m sending good vibes your way!
My DM door is closed to the public, but the server’s wide open!
Just keeping things lowkey — I’m only talking to my trusted circle right now.
